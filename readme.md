### **Importance of research articles**

Research articles are important for disseminating new knowledge and ideas within a field of study, advancing understanding and shaping future research. They are typically written by experts and peer-reviewed for quality before being published in academic journals or conference proceedings. They serve as a means of communication for new ideas and theories, stimulating further research and debate. They also allow researchers to share their findings with a wider audience and gain recognition for their work.



### **Importance of choosing a topic of interest**

Choosing a topic of interest is important when writing a research article as it leads to increased motivation, effort, and quality of the research. It allows for better understanding and knowledge of the subject, easier identification of gaps in existing literature, and writing with more authority and credibility. It also makes the research and writing process more enjoyable and can contribute to career development as a researcher by building a research portfolio in a specific area and identifying future research opportunities.

















### **Important websites for researcher**

There are many websites that can be useful for researchers, depending on their specific field and needs. Here are a few examples of websites that may be helpful:

[Google Scholar](https://www.scholar.google.com): This is a search engine specifically designed for academic literature. It allows you to search for articles, theses, books, and other scholarly literature from various disciplines.

[JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org): JSTOR is a digital library that provides access to thousands of academic journals, books, and primary sources. It covers a wide range of disciplines and is a great resource for finding older or hard-to-find articles.

[IEEE Xplorer](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) : IEEE Xplore is a digital library that provides access to over 4 million technical papers and articles from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET). The library includes journals, conference proceedings, standards, and eBooks in the fields of electrical engineering, computer science, and related technologies. IEEE Xplore is a widely used resource for researchers, practitioners, and students, as it provides access to cutting-edge research and the latest developments in technology. Additionally, IEEE also has a submission and peer-review system called Express Conference Publishing which enables authors to submit their papers and have them reviewed and published in conference proceedings.

[PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/): PubMed is a database of biomedical literature maintained by the National Library of Medicine. It includes over 30 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books.

[Scopus ](http://www.scopus.com): Scopus is an abstract and citation database of research literature and web sources, it covers a wide variety of disciplines and provides a useful tool for tracking citations and measuring research impact.

[ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com): ScienceDirect is a database of more than 14 million scientific, technical, and medical research articles and books. It covers a wide range of scientific and technical disciplines and is a great resource for finding current research in your field.

[ResearchGate ](https://www.researchgate.net): ResearchGate is a social networking site for scientists and researchers. It allows you to share your research, connect with other scientists, and stay up to date on the latest developments in your field.

The Directory of Open Access Journals (www.doaj.org): This website is a directory of open access journals that provide free access to full-text articles.

arXiv (arxiv.org): arXiv is an e-print service in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics.

[Mendeley ](https://www.mendeley.com): Mendeley is a reference management software that allows you to organize and share your research papers, as well as collaborate with other researchers.

These are just a few examples of websites that may be helpful for researchers. I will add more site as soon as I learn. It's always a good idea to check with your university or department to see if they have any resources or databases that are specific to your field.
